# Traffic-Light-Controller

A traffic light controls the traffic at an intersection between a main street M S and a side street SS. The main street has higher priority than the side one, and thus stays green until at least one car on the side street arrives at the intersection. A car sensor SSCS is present on the side street for such a purpose. The sensor outputs a ’1’ at the presence of a car on the side street and a ’0’ otherwise. Normal operation of the traffic light consists of the main street’s traffic light (MSTL) being green and the side street’s (SSTL) being red. The MSTL stays green for a in-system-programmable (ISP) period of time M SC, after which if there is a car on the SS, the MSTL turns yellow for a set period M T , then turns to red. The SSTL then turns green for a ISP period of time SSC, after which it automatically turns yellow (even if there are cars at the intersection) for a set period SST , then red. The MSTL goes back to green at that point. If after MST , there are no cars on the SS, then the MSTL stays green until a car arrives, at which time, the MSTL immediately cycles through its yellow then red changes.
